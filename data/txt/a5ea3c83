SUBJECT:  Recurring Migraines

Alex,

You cannot and will not threaten suicide to your assigned analyst if you ever 
intend to regain your field operational status.  I'm sorry to hear about your 
family.  I know what it is to be divisive with one's family, but I also know 
that if anyone can forgive, it is blood.  I understand it's a sensitive 
subject, but I will not be blackmailed for medication.  I trust we are clear.  

That said, I cannot in good conscience allow an idle threat to become a 
reality.  I have a final appointment at 5pm.  Please come to my office 
at 6pm and we can discuss your medication and anything else you require for 
as long as is needed.  

Best,

Doctor Adrienne Smith, M.D.
Staff Psychiatrist
