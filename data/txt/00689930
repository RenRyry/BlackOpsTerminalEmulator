SUMMARY PROFILE: 

Born and raised in Alaska, the geographical proximity of his home state to 
Communist Russia brought the threat of the Cold War that much closer to his 
doorstep than most Americans.  This is a key contributor to the candidate's 
fervent anti-Communist ideals and eventually led to his enlistment in the 
USMC.  The Candidate spent his youth hunting elk and grizzlies in the Alaskan 
wilderness with his father (a WW2 vet and recipient of the Purple Heart for 
his actions at the Makin Atoll); as such, the candidate is adept in cold 
weather combat techniques and is an excellent sniper (at the age of 20 he 
became the youngest Wimbledon Cup winner in the history of the 
marksmanship competition).

Candidate was recruited to SAD/SOG at the age of 25 after an exemplary term 
of service with the Marines. Having served with distinction since joining the 
Agency, Mason has a long standing friendship with many of his fellow Agency 
colleagues and shows a particular intimacy with operative Frank Woods.

Always itching for action, Mason's tendency towards impulsiveness is the one 
trait that may not have been completely "trained out of him."  However, close 
friend Woods is well aware of this, and knows exactly when and how to reign him 
in.
