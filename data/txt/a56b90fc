Mason,

Stop complaining and go with it. It's new to all of us. You'll need a better 
password first off. "password" doesn't cut it. This is the CIA. You gotta 
protect your secrets and we're in the business of secrets. Go with 
something only you would know, something personal but not obvious.  
Do what I always do.  Combine a name and a number.  
Pick someone important to you, like a mentor or something.  
Then put a date that's important to you on the end.  
For example, the year you won a big award.  Combined those would be pretty 
difficult to guess.

Change your password or I'll do it for you. You do not want me sending 
mails in your name.
