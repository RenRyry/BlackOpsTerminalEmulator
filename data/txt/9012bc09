***TOP SECRET***
***LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE ONLY***


The following is a summary of techniques developed by [REDACTED] under the 
term "Psychic Driving."  

STAGE 1:

Patients are to be "depatterned," which is defined as being reduced to a 
vegetative state through a combination of high level electroconvulsive shock,
drug-induced sleep, and sensory isolation.  When fully depatterned, patients 
will be reduced to incontinence of urine and feces and will be incapable of 
feeding themselves and will show an inability to state their name, location, 
or date.


STAGE 2:

This is where "psychic driving" is introduced.  The process consists of playing
to the patients hundreds of hours of audio loops via earphones, 
specially-designed helmets, and/or speakers in the sensory isolation room.  

For further details, see "A Study of Personality Change Due to Prolonged Repetition 
of Verbal Signals" by [REDACTED].


TEST CASE DP-110910:

One case involved a female patient by the name of [REDACTED], which ran between 
May 5 to September 11 1963.  The treatment involved a combined application of 
3 different techniques: drug disinhibition, prolonged sleep treatment, and 
prolonged psychological isolation.  These were combined with 
Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).  The amount of electricity committed 
to [REDACTED] brain exceeded some 75 times the maximum amount recommended 
by ECT Guidelines per the APA.  

The test case was a success and [REDACTED] experienced a full erasure of her 
memory.  The depatterning techniques applied resulted in permanent and complete 
amnesia from [REDACTED] birth until the end of the test cycle on 11 Sep 1963.  
Medical records show that [REDACTED] was no longer able to recall her name, 
age or location.  She did not recognize her children.  She could no longer 
read or write, drive a car, cook, or use the lavatory.  Not only did she no 
longer recognize her husband, she could not even comprehend the concept of the 
term "husband."
