DISASSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER IN RELATION TO "MANCHURIAN" PROCESSES
Author: Dr. Adrienne Smith M.D.


INTRODUCTION:

This study is a culmination of analysis involving the events surrounding 
CIA agent Alex Mason in relation to the processes of deliberately created 
disassociative personality disorder.  In short, the current psychological 
state of Agent Mason proves the viability of forced creation of 
"multiple personalities" at the hands of trained mind-control experts.  
The Manchurian Process must meet the following criteria:

1.  Deliberately Set Forth
2.  Implanting of a New Identity
3.  Creation of Barriers of Amnesia
4.  Used for Operational Purposes

The contents of the following report will cull data from Project 
ARTICHOKE and MKDELTA as conducted by the Office of Scientific Intelligence.  
The data provided will support the current psychological state of Alex Mason, 
which is a result of his internment and torture within the confines of the 
Vorkuta Soviet Prison Camp.
