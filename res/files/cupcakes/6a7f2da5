Hello everyone,

My lovely wife Bridget, the saint that she is, got up at the crack of dawn 
and made cupcakes. After some significant sweet talking, she coerced me into 
bringing them into the office to share with the other book worms. Swing by 
the break room and sate your sweet tooth!

WARNING: Only 1 cupcake per person. The room is being monitored. Don't make 
me sic the SAD on you....

That goes double for you Sutton.
