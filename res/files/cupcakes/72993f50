Hello everyone,

My lovely wife Bridget, the saint that she is, got up at the crack of dawn 
and made cupcakes. She coerced me into bringing them into the office to share 
with all of you.  They'll be in the coffee room while supplies last.

WARNING: Only 1 cupcake per person. The room is being monitored. Don't make 
me sic the SAD on you.  That goes double for you Stanz and Sutton.
