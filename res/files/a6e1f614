Son,

This is the tenth letter I've sent without response.  Your mother 
has finally passed and you weren't here for her.  I know what it is to be 
loyal and serve and bleed for your country.  But this was your mother.  
And you failed her.  Failed your family.  

Services are in 5 days.  If you're not here, don't ever come back.  
And as far as me and your sisters are concerned, you died in that prison camp.  

5 days.

Signed,

- Dad
