TO: Mason, Alex
FROM:  Weaver, Greg
SUBJECT: Proposition for You

Mason,

Told you I owed you one.  Got a way to start chipping away at that debt. 
That smoking blonde down on the first floor? Her name is Sarah.  
Word is her scum bag fianc√©e had a penchant for ladies of the night.  
She found out, called it off, apparently punched him, too (unconfirmed).  
I tried, but she's not interested in a cyclops like me.  
I mentioned your name though and she was suddenly all ears. 
She's seen you around, has a soft spot for the dark, ugly, and brooding.  
I'll introduce you.  You take her out for drinks. 
Get a little comfort from the fairer species. You could use it.

Weaver
