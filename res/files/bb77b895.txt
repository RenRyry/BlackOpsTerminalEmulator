BATTLE OF BERLIN
SUMMARY PROVIDED BY SCHOOL FOR INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

The Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation
16 Apr 1945 to 2 May 1945


Considered one of the bloodiest battles in history, the Berlin Strategic 
Offensive Operation conducted by the Soviet Union between April 16th and 
May 2nd of 1945.  The war effectively ended with the conquering of the 
Reichstag and planting of the Soviet flag on April 30th.  Fighting continued 
through May 2nd until the official surrender of the German Army by General 
Hasso von Manteuffel, commander of the III Panzer Army, and General 
Kurt von Tippelskirch, commander of the XXI Army.  

Soviet forces suffered over 81,000 KIAs during the course of the offensive.  
Another 280,000-plus were listed as wounded or ill during that time.  
On the flip side, Soviet archival data reports German losses at 458,000 killed 
and 479,000 captured POWs.  However, we find these estimates to be exaggerated 
considering the penchant for propoganda within the Soviet Union.  Actual 
estimates are closer to 100,000 Germans killed in action along with an 
estimated 125,000 civilians loss.  Reports from the Berlin populace during that
time recount tales of revenge-minded Soviet troops engaging in intense rape, 
pillage, and murder.
