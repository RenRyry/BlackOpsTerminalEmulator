Alex,

I'm sorry to hear the medication isn't working as intended.  Let's schedule 
some time tomorrow, say 3pm.  We'll give you a once-over and, if need be, 
discuss dosage.

In the mean time, get some rest.  You've been through a harrowing ordeal 
these past few months.  Consider perhaps a trip home to Anchorage.  See 
your family.  Clear your mind.  At the very least, stay out of the offices.
You'll be surprised how much it can help.

Best,

Doctor Adrienne Smith, M.D.
Staff Psychiatrist
