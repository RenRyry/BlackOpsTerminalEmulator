Alex,

By now you should've received dad's letter.  Dot and I don't necessarily 
agree, but he's got a point.  You should have been here.  
It's unforgivable that you weren't.  We know you've been through a lot, 
but this was our mom.  She needed you and you weren't there for her when 
it was most important.  

She asked after you, before.  We told her you would be here, just hang on.
But she shook her head and smiled.  She said, "He's got more important 
things to do.  My son's a hero.  And I know I'm in his thoughts wherever 
he is."  

She closed her eyes, sighed, and didn't take another breath.  Was she right?
Was she in your thoughts?  Marshall, me, and the kids are heading back to 
Renier in the morning.  If you need a place to go, my door is always open to 
you.  The kids would love to see you, too.  Their hero uncle Alex.  


Love,
Marion
