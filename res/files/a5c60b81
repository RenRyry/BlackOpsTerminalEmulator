SUBJECT: Slow Down

Mason,

Listen.  It's been almost 2 years since Baikonur.  Your fixation with 
Dragovich is bordering on obsessive.  People are talking and not the 
secretaries about the water cooler.  You're poking in files way above your 
pay grade and you're doing it real sloppy.  Lucky you, you got me watching 
your back.

We all want to put a bullet in his head.  And we will.  But slow it down.
It's a team effort and that's the best and only way to get our hands on the 
psycho.  You hear me?  And while I'm on the subject, quit with the mumbling 
to yourself.  You look like you're insane.
