We are on schedule thus far. Stability has been our biggest hurdle. The 
effects, however, are promising and yields results beyond that which was 
requested.

The remaining issues and action items are as [REDACTED]:

a) Stability is still an issue -- we are hoping version 4 will be stable. 
Reference-- Stability Reference No. NOVA.SR 2010032. Stress investigations 
and Long-Term-Testing with trial batches to derive the shelf-life for 
batches in phase II.

b) Further testing inroads modes of dispersion currently underway -- Initial 
findings are positive and lead us to believe only slight modifications will 
be needed [to] retrofit current chemical dispersion techniques. Reference -- 
Dispersion Report No. NOVA.DR 0510032.

c) Long term storage testing is in phase III -- The Containers are currently 
being tested in various environments. Phase III includes Long-term testing at 
25-degrees Celsius at 60% [illegible] for confirmation of findings. Reference 
-- Stability Report No. NOVA.SR 2010022.

d) Means of protection for handlers and handling protocols must be investigated. 
Tests with chimpanzees show current protocols are insufficient. Suggest moving 
to human trials to speed research. Reference -- Trial Report No. NOVA.TR 1915032.

e) Current facilities are inadequate -- The scope of this project has vastly 
increased and as such our needs have outgrown our current faculty. The incident 
last month only reiterates our need for a more permanent and isolated laboratory. 
Reference -- Incident Report NOVA.IR 0002036.
